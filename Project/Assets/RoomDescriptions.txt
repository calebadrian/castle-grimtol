You and your friends decide to wander into the legendary haunted house on the hill.  Clearly you haven't seen enough horror movies or else you would know this would end poorly.  As you enter the door slams behind you and you can't help but feel like this house really is haunted.  And as you stand in the entrance you watch the rooms shift in front of your eyes and an ominous voice booms over you and your friends 'Try to find a way out now through my minions and I shall grant you wealth beyond your imagination.  But know that no one has succeeded this task before!".
As you enter the abandoned room it seems to be completely empty but in serious disrepair.  Of course its hard to tell because it's so dark in here.
As you look over the the grounds of the house you notice that you can't seem to make you anything in the distance you realize there is no help and you must continue onwards.
An elegant ballroom with a magnificent chandeilir hanging from the ceiling you are tempted to stay a while and relax here but just as you start to get even somewhat settled a creature jumps out of the wall what do you do?
As you enter the bedroom you can't help but notice it is set up for a romantic night rose petals on the floor and wine on the nightstand is this real or just a trick?  A ghost reveals herself to you and says 'This was my former home the way you are seeing the room is how it was the night of our anniversary but instead of romance i was met with an axe.'.
You enter the room and notice the room is almost painted in blood it is dripping from the walls.  Maybe one of your friends wandered off and was killed here?  Or is this just where most of the adventurers before me have died?
