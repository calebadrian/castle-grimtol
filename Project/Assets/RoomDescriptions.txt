You and your friends decide to wander into the legendary haunted house on the hill.  Clearly you haven't seen enough horror movies or else you would know this would end poorly.  As you enter the door slams behind you and you can't help but feel like this house really is haunted.  And as you stand in the entrance you watch the rooms shift in front of your eyes and an ominous voice booms over you and your friends 'Try to find a way out now through my minions and I shall grant you wealth beyond your imagination.  But know that no one has succeeded this task before!".
As you enter the abandoned room it seems to be completely empty but in serious disrepair.  Of course its hard to tell because it's so dark in here.
As you look over the the grounds of the house you notice that you can't seem to make you anything in the distance you realize there is no help and you must continue onwards.
An elegant ballroom with a magnificent chandeilir hanging from the ceiling you are tempted to stay a while and relax here but just as you start to get even somewhat settled a creature jumps out of the wall what do you do?
This bedroom seems to be fairly normal but when you walk around the room you begin to feel this presence is following you all around the room.  You think you can surprise it by turning but as you do and face the wall something begins to write on the wall and says 'the reaper is watching'.
You enter the room and notice the room is almost painted in blood it is dripping from the walls.  Maybe one of your friends wandered off and was killed here?  Or is this just where most of the adventurers before me have died?
Walking into the musty catacombs you notice a splash on your feet it is flooded down here.  Really wish you would have worn some boots huh?  The water is icy cold and you don't want to spend any more time in here then you have to.
The stained glass in the room gives you excellent lighting to see everything in the room.  And as you look around you notice something particularly weird though.  The cross on the wall is upside down and as you walk up to it even closer you notice there is a small orb fixed on top.  Maybe you could take it.
This room is barely being held together there is nothing but charcoal and badly burned furniture in this room.  You do see a strange pattern on the wall that reads 'We were wrong to enter there is no escape.'.  After reading this your turn and look in the corner and notice two charred corpses.  It really doesn't look like you are going to survive this.
Just a chasm where a hallway used to be lucky for you there is one board crossing the chasm you better be careful you don't want to fall to your death or anything.
You step into the conservatory and begin to look up and notice that it seems like the sky is spinning much faster than it was before you entered the house.  You begin to wonder how powerful this entity is and what they are capable of.  As you stand there looking up you fail to notice a shadow has entered the room behind you and he doesn't look like he wants hugs.
An empty hallway that leads off in all directions it seems like you will be safe here.
You enter the crypt and all you can notice is the overwhelming smell of dead rotting corpses.  You can't help but feel that something is going to go wrong here.  Sure enough a group of skeletons start to arise from where they have been buried.  Don't you hate it when you are right?
When you enter the dining room you hear voices off in the distance and as you spend more time in the room the voices only get louder and louder until you see ghosts appear one by one giving you a glimpse of what seems to be a dinner party from the past tenants.  There seems to be a lot of talk about some sort of worship and a lot of mention of a vault.
A very dusty hallway that is in serious need of some cleaning.  I mean seriously does no one clean around here anymore?
Somehow you end up back in the foyer you can't help but feel that if this was a normal house you would have entered this room right after you came into the house.  But no you just had to come into the haunted house didn't you?  The fan from the ceiling begins to fall without you noticing and it bonks you on the head you lose 5 health.  Stay on your toes!
The room is so hot you can barely breathe as it is as you look across the room you notice a furnace burning so hot it is almost red hot.  As you sweat the fire continues to grow threatening you.
At first glance this room looks very nice but as you look at the pictures a little more closely you notice that these paintings are sick and twisted.  And if that wasn't enough one of the twisted creatures with a mangled face begins to climb out of the painting and arises in front of your face with a jagged knife.
You are greeted by the beeping of many games that are filling up the space in the game room it looks like it has been almost perfectly curated. Games like pac-man, centepide, space invaders, and many others!  You begin to walk up to your favorite game and as you do pac-man flies out of the machine across the room chomping his mouth up and down and noticing there are a lot of teeth in his mouth.  Luckily he seems to pay no attention to you and seems focused on something else.
You walk into the greehouse and you feel its nice to be somewhat outside but as you walk about the room you notice the plants begin to start to wilt one by one.  You start to investigate the plants noticing that after they wilt they are covered in some toxic acid that is rotting these plants.  You hear footsteps get closer and closer and as they do the reaper finally reveals himself to you!
It's weird that there would be a graveyard in a house right?  That's what I thought too but here we are!  Anyways, you notice that all of the gravestones are marked with the same symbol and phrase.  The symbol seems to be some sort of modified grim reaper and the phrase reads "I trust in the reaper to be my guide".
You walk into the gym only thinking about your short lived career in basketball when you were in high school.  It would be fun to play right now if only you had a basketball.  Good thing there is one all the way across the gym.  As you run towards the ball it launches at your face and you barely duck in time to avoid it and see it explode on the wall.  You hear the voice 'You think I would actually let you enjoy that?  I don't think you will ever get out at this rate.'.
You open this door to what you think is a closet but as the door opens the junk begins to clear and it turns into a long narrow hallway and at the end of the hall a monster begins to assemble itself from the junk as it runs towards you.
You enter the kitchen and see all the knives hanging from the rack above the island.  I bet you really wish you didn't enter this room huh?  As you hear the voice begin to laugh the knives start to fly at you in a flurry.  You try to dodge, dip, dive, duck, and dodge but all your training fails you and you have to pull a knife out of your arm.  You lose 10 health.
As you enter the pantry you see the pantry almost completely empty except for a bone in ham that sits on a silver platter.  Its amazing how food it video games stays good right?  Like that thing should be rotting and gone with how long its been here.
You wander into the library and see a vast collection of books.  As you begin to look at titles of the books along the bookshelves you notice a lot of ominous titles.  A lot of things containing worship and demonic presence.  What were the worshipping and where were they doing it?
As you enter the bedroom you can't help but notice it is set up for a romantic night rose petals on the floor and wine on the nightstand is this real or just a trick?  A ghost reveals herself to you and says 'This was my former home the way you are seeing the room is how it was the night of our anniversary but instead of romance i was met with an axe.'.
You immediately see the operating table here in the operating laboratory and how clean the room seems to be.  Looking around the room you notice many jars on shelves around the room which seem to be filled.  You pick one up and notice they are full of human organs.  You see a label on the bottom of the jar that reads 'property of the reaper' you carefully put it back on the shelf.
Contrary to what the title sounds like the Organ Room doesn't actually contain human organs.  That's a relief right?  Anyways, there is an organ in the room that seems to be playing itself.  Although it is creepy the music isn't bad so you don't let it bother you.
Out on the patio you notice the state of it the boards are cracked and broken almost everywhere its really not much of a patio anymore.  You can hear a low growling coming from underneath the boards only to see red eyes following your every move.  Eventually the hell hound jumps up through the boards to challenge you.
Upon entering the pentagram chamber you notice the pentagrams that litter the room all over the walls and everything that is in the room.  As you look down you see a large pentagram on the floor with what seems to be a charred body almost tied to each side of the pentagram.  Beside the body you find a book and a dagger.
Entering the research laboratory you find that there are many strange tools and machines in this room that you know nothing about.  You read descriptions on these machines and notice that there is a lot of mention of summoning some sort of creature.  Maybe the previous tenants were using these machines to summon creatures to use?
On first inspection you see a basic room with only bunk beds in them pretty much.  On second glance you notice that on each bed though there a shackles to keep people from running away maybe?  You see some scribbles on the wall that are counting days to freedom.  Must have been the servants quarters.  As you come to this realization you notice a very angry presence in the room.  One of the servants shows themselves and shouts at you 'HELP US!' and then quickly fades.
A simple corridor with doors that lead off in every direction.
This storeroom seems to be where the tenants store some of their junk that they never used.  There may be some things of use in here to you though.
As you climb the tower you begin to feel winded it seems like this staircase goes on forever as you continue to climb.  You finally reach the top of the tower and look over the rest of the house and notice there are some strange figures on the roof.  Almost seems to be like gargoyles that are keeping guard.  You continue to keep scanning the roof hoping they don't notice you.  One notices you though and leaps through the tower window to attack you.
